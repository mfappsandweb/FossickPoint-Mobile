<h1>Durotype Commercial License</h1><p>Durotype Standard License Agreement</p>
<p>When you buy a Durotype font, you actually buy a license, i.e. a right to use the font. So, when you purchase a Durotype font license, the font is still owned by Durotype. You buy this license strictly for yourself or your company. You have no right to give a copy of a Durotype font to your friends or business partners. (A Durotype font is computer software designed to generate the characters of a font face.) </p>
<p>By downloading and/or installing a Durotype font, you (or you on behalf of your employer) agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. This agreement, in conjunction with the receipt that accompanies each purchase from Durotype or its distributor, constitutes the complete agreement between you and Durotype or its distributor. </p>
<p>1. Number of Users<br>
The maximum number of simultaneous users is specified in the applicable receipt. All users must belong to the same company or household purchasing the font. </p>
<p>2. Allowed Uses<br>
You may use a Durotype font to create an unlimited number of images on any surface such as paper, computer screens, photographs, web pages, movie credits, printed material, T-shirts, and other surfaces, where the image has a fixed size. You may use a Durotype font to create EPS files or other scalable drawings, provided that such files are only used by the company or individual licensing the font. </p>
<p>3. Fair Use<br>
You need a special license for using a Durotype font, if it is a primary design element of a product sold for profit, or if it is used for a large scale campaign (advertising, corporate identity design, product packaging, entertainment promotion, store signage). This applies to both in-house and client-based work. Contact Durotype for a special license. If a Durotype font is a demo font, you may only use it for testing purposes.</p>
<p>4. Backup<br>
You may make a backup copy of a Durotype font (only for the purpose of data backup). </p>
<p>5. Third Parties<br>
You may send a copy of a Durotype font along with your documents to a commercial printer or other service bureau to enable the printing of your document, provided that such party will use the font exclusively for your work and retain no copies of the font on completion of the work. If the printer or service bureau wants to edit your document, it should own a valid license to use that particular font. </p>
<p>6. Embedding<br>
You may only embed a Durotype font into electronic documents, if it is done in a secured read-only mode. You must ensure that recipients of electronic documents cannot extract a Durotype font from such documents, or use the embedded font for editing purposes or for the creation of new documents. You may not embed a Durotype font into a web site. However, for using a Durotype font as webfont, your vendor may offer a webfont license. You need a special license for embedding a Durotype font into software or hardware products in which the font will be used by the purchasers of such products.Contact Durotype for a special license. For using a Durotype font in an e-book or a mobile application, your vendor may offer an additional license. </p>
<p>7. Modifications<br>
You may import characters from the font as graphical objects into a drawing program and modify such graphical objects, provided that such objects are only used by the company or individual licensing the font. Other modifications are not allowed. You agree that any allowed modifications are considered derivative works, and that use of such derivative work is subject to the terms and conditions of this license agreement. </p>
<p>8. Exclusion of Other Uses<br>
Except for the provisions of this agreement named &#8220;Third Parties&#8221; and &#8220;Embedding&#8221;, you may not sell, lend or otherwise transfer a Durotype font to a third party or parties. You may not transfer a Durotype font to a third party or parties as a component or sub-component of other products, e.g. electronic documents or sublicenses. You may not modify, adapt, translate, rent, lease, distribute, produce, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or redigitize a Durotype font. </p>
<p>9. Rights Reservation<br>
